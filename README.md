# Hadcoin

Hadcoin is a simple project to depict the blockchain creation and replicating the transactions that happen on a basic blockchain.

Creating a blockchain with each block having their hash generated at the time of creation.
Linking the blocks one after another like any global blockchain.
Performing transactions and adding them to the blockchain.

You need Flask, Postman and Etherwallet to run this in your local machine.
